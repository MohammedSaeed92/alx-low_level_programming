**0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings**
* 0-memset.c : a function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
* 1-memcpy.c : a function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
* 2-strchr.c : a function that returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found
* 3-strspn.c : a function that gets the length of a prefix substring and returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept
* 4-strpbrk.c : a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes it locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept and returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found
* 5-strstr.c : a function that locates a substring when finds the first occurrence of the substring in the other string it returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found
* 7-print_chessboard.c : a function that prints the chessboard
* 8-print_diagsums.c : a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers
* 100-set_string.c : a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char
